  Whew! ITM352 has been a whirlwhind of experiences I can honestly say.  I Love programming and the experiences through this class have been great!  In this essay I will be explaining my progress througout the class from WOD assignments, class labs, things that helped me improve in class and the readiness of the complexity of the next class project involving creating a small web application.
  Since the begiining of class, my knowledge of programming was average because of programming I use to "play" with in my highschool days.  After taking this class, it has greatly improved my preception on how coding works such as HTML and Javascript, and also working with up to date coding applications like github and VS code.  Beforehand, I've never had the opportunity to get hands on experience to learning programming so this calss has made my dream come true in a way, by showing me step by step the journey of coding.
  My enthuisiasm with programming still remains dilligent.  i Have psychologically prepared myself for the battle of taking on computer programming and am determind to get this skill down.  Someday I'd like to see myself alongside Facebook owner Mr. Zuckerberg and have a intellectual conversation about coding and his thought process and journey to success through coding.
  Labs in class have helped me tremendously mainly being the reason and only reason that this is the only chance we can ask question in class and do hands on exercises.  I have to honestly admit that due to other educational obligations, I was forced to miss a couple labs in class and deeply regret it.  I realized ITM352 is a class that shouldn't be missed once.  After missing just one lab, I felt so behind as this class is built through the progression of learning lesson upon lesson.  I made it a priority to drop everything I'm doing and to attend class even if it cost me a homework assignment grade from another class.  This class is important to me!
  As far as the WODS go, I still enjoy the way of learning the WODS through screencast.  My learning style is more of a visual type, so I much prefer learning through example.  WODS are like a homework assignment to me and I need to see examples before I can do them.  Some simple WODS I am able to do withought looking such as arrays, but not all.
  I am feeling confident about our next assignment in programming which is building a small web application.  With additional help and advice, I know for a fact that I can complete this class withg a decent grade, and that I am confident enough to do this project.  Examples help me alot though such as Professor Port's template he uploaded on github.
  The ways this class can improve in my opinion is the speed of learning.  I feel the class moves so fast at times, and maybe having a large number of students in one class adheres the 1 on 1 help experience.  So maybe slower learning pace and smaller classes would greatly help learning.
  The things that work really well in class are the screencast for the WODS and the Labs done in class.  WODs are great for home learning experiences granted with a screencast of course, and the step by step learning process with the LABS.  
  I enjoys this class and look forward to the challenges next to come!
