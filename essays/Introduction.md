Aloha,
  My name is Frank Rabanal and I am a MIS major at the Shidler Business School at UH Manoa.  The reason why I chose to major in MIS was because I was told that this major was fairly new, and would be the future of business for the years to come.  MIS was not my first choice to major in though.  I was originally going for my Business Management degree, and when I finally made the transfer to the Shidler School of Business, times in the world have changed.  New trends seem to be directing toward more technological advancement and technology seems to be surrounding our daily lives more and more than ever now.  So what better subject to major in for the future of business?  This was my thought process as I decided to take on the challenge of majoring in MIS.
